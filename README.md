# WordlGame Solver

Considering the rise of [Wordl](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) and many [spin-offs](https://hellowordl.net/), I made a simple Python code to predict the answer, by filtering out from a dataset.

On running StrPlayer.py, you can either choose M for Manual or A for Auto. Auto uses the WordlGame class, while Manual invovles manually keying in your interactions with any wordle game. 

The keying must be as follows:

0 represents the letter not existing in the word,
1 represents the letter existing but not in the correct position,
2 represents the letter existing and in the correct position. 

Once the coded output is entered, you get the options to choose from.

Entering -1 for attempt takes you back to the original menu.
